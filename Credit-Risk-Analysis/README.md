Certainly! Developing an entire architecture for a loan approval prediction app using Redis, Docker, and FastAPI involves several components and steps. Below, I'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up the architecture for the app.

The architecture will consist of the following components:

1. FastAPI App: The main web application that handles form submissions, data processing, and loan approval prediction.
2. Redis: A key-value store used to cache predictions for faster response times.
3. Docker: Used to containerize the FastAPI app and Redis, making it easy to deploy and manage the entire application.

Let's start building the architecture:

Step 1: Set Up the FastAPI App

Create a new directory for your project and create a Python virtual environment inside it:

```bash
mkdir loan_approval_app
cd loan_approval_app
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas joblib redis
```

Next, create a new Python file named `main.py` inside the project directory with the following code:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Form, HTTPException
import pandas as pd
import logging
import joblib
import redis
import os

app = FastAPI()
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

# Function to predict loan approval
def predict_loan_approval(input_data):
    # Replace this with your actual machine learning model prediction code
    # For demonstration purposes, we'll return a random prediction (0 or 1)
    import random
    return random.randint(0, 1)

# Initialize Redis client
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='redis', port=6379, decode_responses=True)

# Home page
@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the Loan Prediction API!"}

# Prediction page
@app.post("/prediction")
def predict(name: str = Form(...),
            # Add other form fields here based on your form
           ):
    # Combine form fields into a dictionary to represent the input data
    input_data = {
        "name": name,
        # Add other form fields as key-value pairs here
    }

    # Convert input data to a DataFrame (replace this with your data preprocessing)
    df = pd.DataFrame([input_data])

    # Check if the prediction is cached in Redis
    cache_key = json.dumps(input_data, sort_keys=True)
    cached_prediction = redis_client.get(cache_key)
    if cached_prediction is not None:
        prediction = int(cached_prediction)
    else:
        # Make the prediction
        prediction = predict_loan_approval(df)
        # Cache the prediction in Redis for future use
        redis_client.set(cache_key, prediction)

    # Determine the output message based on the prediction
    if prediction == 1:
        output_msg = f"Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms {name}, your loan is approved!"
    else:
        output_msg = f"Sorry Mr/Mrs/Ms {name}, your loan is rejected!"

    # Return the prediction result as a JSON response
    return {"prediction": output_msg}
```

Step 2: Create a Redis Docker Container

Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in the project directory with the following content:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  fastapi-app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    depends_on:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: "redis:latest"
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

Step 3: Create a Dockerfile

Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in the project directory with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi:python3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY ./main.py /app/main.py
```

Step 4: Run the Application

Create a new file named `requirements.txt` in the project directory with the following content:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
pandas
joblib
redis
```

Now, you have set up the entire architecture for the loan approval prediction app. To run the application, execute the following commands in the project directory:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

The FastAPI app will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/. You can access the root path in your web browser, and the loan approval prediction form will be available at http://localhost:8000/prediction. You can fill out the form, submit it, and receive the loan approval prediction as a JSON response.

Note: In this example, we used a dummy function for `predict_loan_approval()` that returns random predictions. You should replace this function with your actual machine learning model prediction code.

That's it! You now have a loan approval prediction app with Redis caching, all containerized using Docker.
